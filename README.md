### Installation
 
Clone this repository using `git clone`. Create a `.env` file that contains `MONGODB_URI` parameter that points to your database. Lastly, run `npm install` to install all the dependancies.
 
### Usage
 
This is an api backend, so everything goes through the `/api` route. You may access users and thoughts using the `GET` methods by accessing `/api/users` and `/api/thoughts` respectively. You may also modify these items using the `PUT` methods, create new ones using `POST` methods, and delete them using `DELETE` methods. Every action will automatically reflect on the database upon accessing these routes.
